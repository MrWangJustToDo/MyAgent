/**
 * Capability-mapping guard for models.dev metadata.
 * (change: add-extension-message-transform)
 *
 * `parseModelsDevModel` translates provider metadata into our `ModelCapability[]`, and every
 * downstream gate reads that list through `hasCapability` — which is **permissive** when the
 * list is empty. So both failure directions matter:
 *
 *   - a capability granted without metadata evidence is a silent authorization (the caller
 *     believes the model supports something nobody checked);
 *   - a capability list that comes back EMPTY after a successful parse flips every gate to
 *     "unknown → allow", because empty means unknown to the probe.
 *
 * This drives the real `deriveCapabilities` against the real cached models.dev payload, so it
 * tests the mapping rather than a restatement of it. When the cache is absent (fresh clone,
 * offline) the corpus checks are skipped with a notice — the invariant checks still run.
 *
 * Run: pnpm --filter @my-agent/core run validate:model-capabilities
