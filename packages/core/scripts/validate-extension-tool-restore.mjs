/**
 * Validates that disabling an extension restores what its tool registration displaced.
 *
 * Run: pnpm --filter @codent/core run validate:extension-tool-restore
 *
 * Background. `ExtensionRegistryService.registerTool` writes straight into the agent's live
 * tools record, which is the ONLY holder of the previous tool — nothing keeps a copy of the
 * built-ins (`agent-factory.ts` spreads `createTools()` into the record and drops the local).
 * `unregisterExtensionTool` therefore used to `delete` the name unconditionally, so an
 * extension that shadowed `read_file` took the built-in with it on disable: `/extensions`
 * off, `read_file` gone, restart required.
 *
 * Two more things the same overwrite broke, both silent:
 *
 *   - `toModelOutputRegistry` is process-global and was never rolled back, so the unloaded
 *     extension's shaper kept formatting the restored tool's results for the model
 *     (`apply-tool-compact.ts` reads it on every model call).
 *   - The presentation descriptor went with it, so the restored tool was described by the
 *     fallback table — or by nothing at all when it is not a built-in, which sets
 *     `keepsCompactRow` false and drops its historical rows out of the compact view.
 *
 * A third is specific to a HANDOVER (an older extension released while a newer one still holds
 * the name): clearing the whole presentation entry there takes a live owner's descriptor with it
 * and leaves a registered tool described by the fallback table. Section 9 pins that.
 *
 * The design being pinned is a per-name stack in all three registries, keyed by owner:
 *
 *   - `ExtensionRegistryService.toolStacks` — what each owner registered, per name
 *   - `presentation/registry.ts` `declared` — what each owner declared, per name
 *   - `toModelOutputRegistry.stacks` — what each owner shapes with, per name
 *
 * Entries carry their own implementation, never the one they displaced, so "remove this owner,
 * re-read the top" is the only rule — the same operation whether the owner was on top or buried.
 * That is what makes one owner's release unable to resurrect another's tool, and what the earlier
 * displacement-ledger design got wrong in both directions.
 *
 * What is pinned here:
 *
 *   1. a shadowed built-in comes back on unregister, with its own tool object
 *   2. the extension's `toModelOutput` is rolled back to the built-in's
 *   3. an extension tool that shadowed nothing is still simply removed
 *   4. two extensions on one name: the name is handed back in reverse order, and only the last
 *      one out removes it (no resurrecting the built-in underneath both)
 *   5. a handover drops the older owner's artifacts and leaves the survivor untouched
 *   6. one owner registering the same name twice is released as a unit
 *   7. an owner that never registered the name never deletes it
 *   8. both disable orders, end to end through the real runner
 *   9. a handover keeps the surviving owner's presentation descriptor
 *  10. the per-name stack replaces an owner's entry rather than growing with agents

//
// The two orders are genuinely different paths through the host stack, not one with a different

// owns the name) followed by the last holder leaving.
//

// case itself — its own per-runner `name → owner` map answered "is this name still mine?" with
// `true` on an agent whose tool was never the one taken, so the buried extension took the
// unregister path against a stack holding a live owner and the built-in never came back.
