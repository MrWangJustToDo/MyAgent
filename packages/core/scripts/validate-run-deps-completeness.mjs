/**
 * Runner dependency-bag completeness gate.
 *
 * `buildAgentRunner` assembles every middleware from one {@link AgentRunDeps} bag, and
 * two invariants keep that meaningful. Both are invisible at runtime and both were
 * violated by hand-written code before this gate existed:
 *
 * 1. **Every declared field is read.** The bag is a hand-written object, so a field can
 *    survive after its last reader moves to a live accessor — it did: the accessor
 *    migration left `todoManager` / `extensionRunner` as 0-read snapshots, and nothing
 *    noticed, because no gate read `AgentRunDeps` at all.
 * 2. **No factory argument reaches into `managed` directly.** The bag exists so the
 *    assembly reads one surface; a stray `managed.getX()` re-introduces the second path
 *    that makes the bag look complete when it is not.
 *
 * A third property is *not* checked here because it cannot be seen from one file: whether
 * a captured field may go stale. That is the liveness contract documented on
 * `AgentRunDeps` — the runner is cached, so plain fields must be set-once collaborators
 * and anything rebuildable must be a `getX()` accessor. Capturing a mutable field as a
 * plain value passes this gate and still hands middleware a stale reference; the contract
 * note is the only guard, which is why it is spelled out at the interface.
 *
 * Run: pnpm --filter @codent/core run validate:run-deps-completeness
