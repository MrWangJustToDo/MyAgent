/**
 * Validation: MCP tools declare a presentation descriptor, and their registrations are
 * owner-scoped so nothing leaks across a server restart.
 *
 * Two bugs this pins, both of which were silent:
 *
 *  1. The MCP extension registered every discovered tool with `ctx.registerTool` and no
 *     `present`, so an MCP tool resolved **no descriptor at all**. Its name is not in the
 *     built-in table either, so the fallback could not cover it: the tool lost both its row
 *     (`keepsCompactRow` false) and its result block (`hasDetailedOutputBlock` false), and a
 *     remote host could not recover either — the catalog is built from
 *     registered + declared + built-in, and an MCP tool was in none of them.
 *
 *  2. The model-output registration used the **default** owner (the tool name), while the
 *     extension registry removes MCP registrations by the extension's id. The removal was
 *     therefore a miss: entries survived `shutdown()`, a name shared with a built-in kept
 *     shadowing that built-in's shaping, and nothing ever pruned the stack.
 *
 * The assertions drive the **real** `createMcpExtension` through a real `ExtensionRunner`,
 * with only the network boundary (`McpManager.initialize`) stubbed. A hand-written
 * `registerTool` call would test nothing: the bug WAS the missing field at that call site, so
 * the test has to read the call site's actual argument.
 *
 * Run: pnpm --filter @codent/core run validate:mcp-tool-presentation
