/**
 * Validation: the user-cancel contract is one semantic with two wire shapes.
 *
 * Run: pnpm --filter @codent/core run validate:cancel-semantics
 *
 * A cancelled tool call can be written by three producers, and they do not agree on the field
 * name: the framework fallback and the built-in tools that catch their own abort write
 * `cancelled: true`, while the `task` tool writes `aborted: true` (its subagent cancels
 * instead of throwing, so the tool returns normally). Reading only one of the two is how the
 * original defect appeared — "only `task` shows cancelled".
 *
 * The invariant that keeps the two shapes one semantic is `isCancelledOutputMarker` (both
 * markers) plus `isSyntheticCancelOutput` (which of the two `cancelled` producers it is).
 * This script pins:
 *
 *   1. the marker tables — both markers, both read from `output` alone
 *   2. the framework fallback's real output — every tool gets a readable cancel, opted in or not
 *   3. both markers readable off a persisted part, the way a host reads them after a resume
 *   4. "could Esc cut this tool short?" answered at every tool definition site, enforced
 *      against the source so a new tool cannot quietly skip the question
 *   5. the model-facing projection carries the flag (it is not a UI-only concern)
 *   6. the derived status flags cannot contradict a cancel
 *   7. the lifecycle events that report a cancel carry the verdict, and the log wording
 *      follows it — a cancel reaches the log as a cancel, a fault as a fault
