/**
 * Extension event observation — the read side of the extension event surface.
 *
 * The regression this guards is silent: interception (`ctx.events.on`) has always existed, so an
 * observation API that *looks* present but delivers nothing, delivers too much, or leaks across a
 * disable is easy to ship and hard to notice. Each positive assertion is therefore paired with an
 * inversion — a negative case that fails if the positive one would pass trivially.
 *
 * Covered:
 *   1. The observable set expands to every non-internal event and excludes the internal ones.
 *   2. `observe` delivers a declared event and its disposer unsubscribes.
 *   3. Retained replay: `observe` replays the current value synchronously; `{ replay: false }`
 *      suppresses it; `retained` reads on demand.
 *   4. `observeAny` receives declared events and does NOT receive `tool:chunk` / `extension:ui`,
 *      and does not replay retained values at subscribe time.
 *   5. The bus wildcard invariant: core has exactly one `on("*")` (the log consumer, which
 *      still owns the bridge's subscription while the bridge is being moved).
 *   6. Wildcard delivery excludes internal events: a wildcard listener never receives one, which
 *      is what keeps a subscriber that produces internal events from observing its own output.
 *   7. The declared internal set matches this validator's list in both directions, and no
 *      internal event carries an event→entry rule (the rule could never run — wildcard delivery
 *      withholds internal events — so the two tables must not disagree).
 *
 *   6. A throwing observer does not stop a second observer on the same event.
 *   7. A rejected observer promise is reported as `agent:extension-error` (observer phase) and
 *      never surfaces as an unhandled rejection.
 *   8. Disable unsubscribes observers; re-enable + re-register fires each handler exactly once.
 *   9. Observed payloads are the same object other consumers see (the read-only contract).
 *
 * Run: pnpm --filter @codent/core run validate:extension-event-observation
