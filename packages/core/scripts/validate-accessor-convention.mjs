/**
 * Accessor-convention gate.
 *
 * Core classes must expose ONE way to read a value: either a property-like getter
 * (`get foo()`) or a method (`getFoo()`), never both for the same concept — and, for
 * the classes named below, never a bare getter at all.
 *
 * Why a gate instead of a convention note: `ManagedAgent` had both
 * `get todoManager()` and `getTodoManager()` (identical bodies), so a reader had to
 * know which spelling was "the" one, and the surface grew variants
 * (`skillRegister` vs `getSkillRegistry`). A convention nobody checks is a
 * convention that drifts back — this repository's own history (`findCutPoint`
 * documented long after deletion, a boundary gate that covered 2 of 6 edges) is the
 * evidence.
 *
 * Two rules:
 *
 * 1. **No duplicates.** A class may not declare a getter and a method that resolve to
 *    the same concept (same name, or `foo` + `getFoo`).
 * 2. **Method form on the frozen list.** Classes on {@link METHOD_ONLY_CLASSES} must
 *    not use property getters for state access at all: the write side is already
 *    methods (`setTodoManager`, `setUIChannel`), and state here is a *snapshot*, not
 *    a plain field — `managed.status` reads as data while `getStatus()` reads as a
 *    call, which is the honest signal.
 *
 * Run: pnpm --filter @codent/core run validate:accessor-convention
