/**
 * Module-organization gate.
 *
 * Three rules from `AGENTS.md` ("Core Naming Conventions") were honoured by hand and had
 * silently drifted, because nothing read the tree:
 *
 * 1. **A module name states its responsibility.** The placeholder list is small and
 *    deliberate (`helpers.ts` / `misc.ts` / `utils.ts` / `common.ts` / `shared.ts`).
 *    `tools/util/helpers.ts` was the one that had slipped through.
 * 2. **A domain directory exposes `index.ts`, and its barrel is consumed.** A barrel that
 *    nothing imports is dead weight that reads as an API; `managers/index.ts` and
 *    `managers/stream-recovery/index.ts` were both exactly that.
 * 3. **A public symbol has one definition.** Two `isToolCallPart` copies (one `null`-safe,
 *    one not) and two different `TaskRunPhase` unions under one name is the failure this
 *    catches — a duplicate that compiles is one whose behaviour quietly diverges.
 * 4. **A path a document names exists.** A main spec listed `src/agent/run-helpers/` for a
 *    directory that had been deleted, and `AGENTS.md` still named
 *    `models/prompt-cache.ts` for a file at `models/cache/prompt-cache.ts`. Nothing read
 *    either, so both pointed at nothing for as long as they survived. See the rule-4
 *    section for why this checks existence only.
 *
 * Rule 3 is checked for a curated watch-list rather than every symbol: a *deliberate*
 * re-export (`export { x } from "./y.js"`) is the barrel pattern these rules encourage, so
 * a blanket scan would flag the design. The list names the symbols where two independent
 * definitions would be a bug; add to it when a duplicate is found, as one was for
 * `isToolCallPart`.
 *
 * Run: pnpm --filter @codent/core run validate:module-organization

// cross-domain imports use direct module paths there." A rule that requires a barrel
// everywhere contradicts that policy and would have flagged a documented decision. What is
// worth catching is the other half: an aggregation file that nothing imports. It reads as
// an API, so its exports look supported while being unreachable by any consumer — dead
// weight with a misleading shape. (`agent/compaction/index.ts` and
// `agent/persistence/index.ts`, by contrast, are consumed from `managers/` and stay.)

// A main spec required barrels in `src/agent/run-helpers/` long after that directory was
// deleted, and `AGENTS.md` named `packages/core/src/models/prompt-cache.ts` for a file that
// lives at `models/cache/prompt-cache.ts`. Both are the same failure — a document asserting a
// location that is not there — and neither was visible because nothing read the documents.
//
// Scope is documentation and specs, not source comments. A comment naming a path is read next
// to the code it describes and is often a deliberate generalisation ("the way
// `runtime-types/middleware-phase.ts` does"); scanning every comment for path-shaped tokens
// yields prose, not claims. Docs and specs exist to be accurate about the tree, they are few
// (32 references as written), and both known-stale references live in them.
//
// **Existence only — deliberately not the stronger rule.** A tempting form is "an importer
// taking 2+ symbols from one directory must use its barrel root" (`AGENTS.md`: "import from the
// directory root when consuming 2+ symbols"). Measured against the tree that rule fails **81
// import sites across 26 directories**, because the convention is aspirational everywhere and
// enforced nowhere. A gate that fails 81 legitimate sites gets disabled, which is worse than no
// gate — it teaches that the *other* rules here are negotiable. So rule 4 checks what is binary
// and what actually broke: does the path resolve.
