/**
 * Validate that no tool body constructs a POSIX shell command string.
 *
 * Why this exists: the tools used to build command strings containing `set -o pipefail`,
 * `2>/dev/null`, and `| head -n N`. That silently committed every search tool to bash —
 * `set -o pipefail` is not a PowerShell option, so on Windows `glob`, `grep`, `tree`, and
 * skill loading were parse errors rather than degraded results. Reading code does not catch
 * a regression here, because a new `runCommand(` call looks perfectly ordinary.
 *
 * The check is pattern-based on purpose: it flags the shell-only constructs themselves,
 * which is exactly the set of things that cannot work outside a POSIX shell.
