/**
 * Package-internal runner / adapter / UI wiring for `ManagedAgent`.
 *
 * These four fields are one cluster, not four: the cached `AgentRunner` is only
 * valid for the config it was built from, so every change to the tool set, model
 * or system prompt has to invalidate the cache *before* the next run reads it.
 * Keeping the fields and that rule in one place is what makes "changing the tools
 * without dropping the cached runner" unexpressible rather than merely discouraged.
 *
 * The runner is memoized per {@link RunnerWiring.getRunnerConfigKey}, and the key
 * is derived from the frozen system prompt + model style + the tool set (see
 * `run-agent.ts`) — so the key and the runner must move together, which is the
 * second reason they are not spread across the class body.
 *
 * Extracted from `ManagedAgent` (architecture debt P1-15). The host interface is
 * the codebase's standard seam shape (see `managed-agent-compact.ts`): pass
 * `() => value` accessors, not `this`, so the module has no dependency on the
 * composition root and can be validated on its own.
