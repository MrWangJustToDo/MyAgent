/**
 * Extension message-transform middleware — the wire seam for
 * `ExtensionContext.registerMessageTransformer`.
 *
 * Placement contract: this middleware MUST run immediately after `compaction`
 * (same `context-transform` phase, adjacent in `CANONICAL_MIDDLEWARE_ORDER`), and
 * **only** consumes the messages it receives via `config.messages`.
 *
 * Why placement is the whole design here: `compaction` is channel-anchored — it
 * rebuilds the wire from `channel.getMessages()` and ignores whatever the incoming
 * `config.messages` held. Anything that wants to transform the model-facing chain
 * therefore has to sit AFTER that projection, otherwise its output is discarded by
 * the very next projection and it silently applies to the first call only (the exact
 * failure mode already present for the `max_tokens` continuation prompt, which is
 * appended to the wire in `run-stream-recovery` and then overwritten).
 *
 * This middleware deliberately does not reach into `compaction`: it reads the
 * messages it is handed and returns replacements, so the compaction cache contract
 * and keep-policy logic stay untouched. Keeping transformers out of `compaction`
 * also means an extension-free workspace never touches that middleware's internals.
 *
 * Zero-overhead contract: when no extension holds a transformer this returns `{}`
 * (no config change), so the pipeline behaves exactly as before.
