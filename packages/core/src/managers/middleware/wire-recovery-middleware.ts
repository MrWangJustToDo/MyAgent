/**
 * `wire-recovery` middleware — applies the per-run wire overrides that must
 * survive the channel projection.
 *
 * Placement contract: this middleware MUST run AFTER `message-transform` (and
 * therefore after `compaction`). Both of those orderings are load-bearing, for
 * opposite reasons:
 *
 * - After `compaction`, because that middleware rebuilds the wire from
 *   `channel.getMessages()` and discards the incoming `config.messages`. An
 *   override applied before it reaches the first call of a run only, then is
 *   overwritten on every later call — the exact failure this middleware exists to
 *   fix (`capability-sanitize` and `max-tokens-continue` both used to write
 *   straight into the messages handed to the engine).
 * - After `message-transform`, because a capability strip replaces media parts
 *   with a placeholder. Running the strip first would mean an extension sees
 *   `[Media omitted …]` instead of the actual image, so the transform seam's
 *   headline use case (replace an attachment with text from an out-of-process
 *   multimodal endpoint) could never run for a model that lacks vision. Ordering
 *   the strip last keeps the extension's view of the chain faithful.
 *
 * Everything here is wire-only. The channel — and therefore the persisted session
 * and the transcript UI — keeps the original media parts, so nothing in a
 * capability strip or a continuation prompt is ever durable.
 *
 * Zero-overhead contract: with no override armed (the common case, and always the
 * case for subagents and for models with full capabilities) this returns `{}`, so
 * the pipeline behaves exactly as if the middleware did not exist.
