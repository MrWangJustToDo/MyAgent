 * Instrumentation for the middleware pipeline — not a middleware factory, but it stays in
 * `managers/middleware/` deliberately. Unlike `synthetic-injection.ts` (whose dependencies all
 * live under `agent/`, so it belongs there), this module is *about* the pipeline the manager
 * layer assembles: it wraps an already-built `ChatMiddleware[]` and its sole consumer is
 * `buildAgentRunner` (`managers/run-agent.ts`), the same function that owns the phase sort. Its
 * one import is type-only from `agent/agent-log` (the emission seam), so moving it to `agent/`
 * would place pipeline-assembly knowledge in the domain layer to satisfy a filename convention.
 *
 * `phase.ts` and `wire-projection-cache.ts` sit here for the same reason: the name of the file
 * states what it does, and what it does is a manager-layer concern.
