/**
 * The complete collaborator surface {@link buildAgentRunner} needs from a
 * `ManagedAgent`, so the assembly reads one object instead of reaching into the
 * agent from every factory argument.
 *
 * **Liveness contract.** The bag is built at runner-build time, but the runner it
 * feeds is *cached* (`ensureAgentRunner`): `runnerConfigKey` only watches the tool
 * set, model, sampling and plan phase, so a rebuilt-on-change field would hand
 * middleware a stale reference for the life of the cache. Two groups, and the split
 * is the point of this note:
 *
 * - **Plain fields** are safe to capture because they are assigned exactly once
 *   during construction and never replaced — the `ManagedAgent` collaborators
 *   (`usage`, `memory`, `session`, …), plus `config` and the immutable `parentId`.
 * - **`getX()` accessors** are required for anything that can outlive the build:
 *   the log sink, the models.dev lookup that lands after the first turn, and all
 *   conversation state. Reading these as fields is the bug this shape prevents.
 *
 * Mutation is deliberately out of scope: `setLog` / `setModelInfo` stay on the agent,
 * which is what keeps the dependency one-way.
 *
 * Scope is the runner's needs, not "everything on `ManagedAgent`": `managed.tools`
 * stays out because it is read once inside {@link runnerConfigKey} — the cache key
 * itself — where a live accessor would be meaningless.

 * `ManagedAgent`. It stayed split afterwards with no second producer and no consumer outside
 * `managers/` — the type is referenced only by this file, `run-agent.ts` and the gate that reads
 * `agent-run-deps.ts` as text. Two files, one topic, so they are one file: a reader asking
 * "what does the runner need, and where does it come from" gets both answers here, and a field
 * added to one half in isolation is no longer a possible mistake. The liveness split above is
 * real and stays; the file split was not.
