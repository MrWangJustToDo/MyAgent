/**
 * Is this error the user aborting the run, rather than a failure?
 *
 * The question has to be answered in three places that cannot share a call stack: the run
 * coordinator (did the pump stop because of an abort?), and any tool that received an
 * `abortSignal` and has to decide whether to settle as "cancelled" or to throw. Leaving each
 * one its own heuristic is how the shapes drifted apart — a tool matched
 * `ExecutionError.code === "aborted"`, the coordinator matched `name === "AbortError"` plus a
 * substring, and a remote CoreEnv reconstructs the error over HTTP so the class identity is
 * gone by the time it arrives. This is the one predicate for all of them.
 *
 * `signal` is checked first and is the strongest evidence: if the run's controller is already
 * aborted, the throw is the abort, whatever the error looks like.
 *
 * The message branch is the last resort, and it matches an abort WORD rather than one exact
 * string — because by the time the error has crossed into a tool-call part only its message is
 * left (TanStack writes `{ error: message }`), and the two producers disagree on the text:
 * `native-run` throws `ExecutionError("aborted", "Command aborted")` and the node shell throws a
 * bare `Error("aborted")`. Matching `=== "aborted"` recognized only the second, so an abort that
 * reached the render layer as "Command aborted" was classified as a plain failure. The word
 * anchor keeps it from over-reaching: "abort" must appear as a word, and a timeout is not an
 * abort ("Command timed out after 30s" does not match).

 *
 * - the framework fallback (`cancelInFlightToolCalls` / `cancelIncompleteToolCalls`) settles an
 *   interrupted tool with `{ success: false, error, cancelled: true }` — a SHARED shape that is no
 *   tool's output schema, and which carries no output at all, because the tool never returned;
 * - a tool that caught its own abort returns a FULL output with `cancelled: true` — `run_command`
 *   includes the stdout the command managed to print before the stop.
 *
 * A formatter must not read the first (there is nothing there to read — `run_command` rendered the
 * literal `Exit code: undefined`, and `todo` threw). The second is a real result and must still
 * render, minus the exit code. Telling them apart by "does it carry anything besides the marker"
 * is exactly the difference between "we have no output" and "we have partial output".
