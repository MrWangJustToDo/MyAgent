/**
 * Extension message-transformer registry.
 *
 * `ExtensionContext.registerMessageTransformer` is the one extension surface that
 * rewrites the message chain the model sees. The registration/apply mechanics live here
 * rather than in `runner.ts` because they are a self-contained concern: a per-extension
 * map, a fast-path guard for the wire seam, and an ordered chain with failure isolation.
 * The runner only owns the lifecycle wiring (create, disable, destroy).
 *
 * Ownership contract (why {@link MessageTransformerRegistry.apply} copies its input):
 *
 * The compact path hands out the only non-owned array in the pipeline —
 * `WireProjectionCache.getOrCompute` returns the SAME array reference it retains, and the
 * engine's `applyMiddlewareConfig` assigns that reference straight to its live message
 * state. Handing it out as-is would make two documented promises false at once:
 *
 *   1. "in-place edits stay out of the cache" — `m.content = ...` would write through to
 *      the array the cache keeps;
 *   2. "the transformer runs again on the next call" — a cache hit would hand back the
 *      already-mutated array, so a transformer that mutates and returns `void` would
 *      silently become a no-op on the second call.
 *
 * So ownership is granted structurally: a fresh outer array AND fresh message objects.
 * The boundary is deliberate and documented — the `content` parts *inside* a message are
 * still shared, because cloning them would mean walking every part of every model call.
 * A transformer that wants to change a part returns a new message rather than mutating.
