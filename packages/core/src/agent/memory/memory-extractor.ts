/**
 * Memory Extractor - Background extraction and consolidation of memories.
 *
 * After each agent turn, this module analyzes recent conversation messages
 * and extracts new memories (user preferences, project facts, feedback).
 *
 * Both operations are one-shot structured queries against a Zod contract:
 * the schema is sent as the provider's output schema and validates the reply,
 * so a text-shaped response can never be mistaken for a valid one and no
 * pattern-matching recovery is needed.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const count = await extractMemories(messages, memoryManager, textAdapter, log);
 * // Returns number of newly extracted memories
 *
 * await consolidateMemories(memoryManager, textAdapter, log);
 * // Merges/deduplicates when threshold exceeded
 * ```

const EXTRACTION_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You are a memory extraction assistant. Your role is to identify and extract \
durable knowledge from conversation transcripts that should be remembered across sessions.

Reply with a JSON **object** containing a single key "memories", whose value is the array of \
extracted entries. No prose, no markdown code fences, no other top-level keys.

Each entry in "memories" MUST contain exactly these fields, and MUST NOT add others:
  - "name": short kebab-case identifier (e.g. "user-preference-tabs")
  - "type": one of ${memoryTypeSchema.options.join(", ")}
  - "description": one-line summary for index lookup
  - "body": full detail in markdown
  - "importance" (optional): number 0–1 rating how valuable this memory is across future
    sessions; omit it for typical entries rather than inventing a value.
  - "expiresAt" (optional): ISO timestamp when this memory stops being relevant; omit for
    durable memories.

You extract (prefer capturing rather than skipping when unsure):
- User preferences (coding style, tool choices, communication preferences)
- User corrections and feedback (things the user corrected or asked you to do differently)
- Project facts (architecture, conventions, dependencies, workflows, tool contracts)
- Decisions and constraints the user stated for this repo or agent behavior
- External references (URLs, docs, tools mentioned)

Rules:
- Extract reusable knowledge that would help a future session — when in doubt, extract a short entry
- Do NOT extract ephemeral one-off task chatter (temporary file paths, one-time debug noise, transient errors)
- Do NOT duplicate information already covered by existing memories (update wording only if clearly new)
- Keep descriptions concise (one line)
- Keep body content focused and specific
- Use kebab-case for names (e.g., "user-prefers-tabs")
- Use an empty "memories" array only when the dialogue truly has nothing durable`;

const CONSOLIDATION_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You are a memory consolidation assistant. Your role is to merge, \
deduplicate, and clean up a collection of memory entries.

You will receive a lightweight catalog of all memories (filename, name, type, description — NO body).
Your job is to decide which memories to merge, delete, or keep.

Rules:
1. Merge memories that cover the same topic into a single entry. Provide the merged description and body.
2. Delete memories that are outdated, contradicted, or no longer useful.
3. Prefer merging over deleting; keep a healthy set (roughly under 40) without discarding useful project facts.
4. Preserve user preferences and feedback above all else.
5. Keep descriptions concise (one line).
6. Use kebab-case for names.

Field notes:
- Every entry in "merged" MUST contain exactly these fields, and MUST NOT add others:
  - "name": short kebab-case identifier (e.g. "user-preference-tabs")
  - "type": one of ${memoryTypeSchema.options.join(", ")}
  - "description": one-line summary for index lookup
  - "body": full merged detail in markdown
  - "replaces": the source filenames this entry replaces
- "importance" (optional): 0–1 weight for the merged entry; omit to keep default.
- "expiresAt" (optional): ISO expiry; omit unless the merged topic is time-bound.
- "deleted": files to remove outright (outdated/contradicted).
- Files not mentioned in either list are kept as-is.
- If no changes are needed, return empty "merged" and "deleted" lists.
- Reply with the JSON object only — no prose, no markdown code fences.`;

/**
 * Extraction returns the entries under an object key, **not** as a bare array.
 *
 * The array is the natural shape, and the old schema used it — but a top-level
 * array reaches the provider as `{ type: "object", properties: {} }`, because the
 * structured-output request is built from the schema's `properties` (see
 * `assertObjectRootSchema` in `models/adapter/side-text-query.ts`). The model then
 * invents a wrapper key (`value`, `input`, `entries`, …) and the reply can never
 * match, so extraction returned zero memories on every turn while logging a schema
 * error that read like a flaky model. The key is pinned here and named in the
 * prompt so the two cannot disagree.
 *
 * **Failure is all-or-nothing, deliberately.** One malformed entry rejects the
 * whole response, so the caller writes nothing rather than writing the entries
 * that happened to survive. The trade-off is explicit: the system prompt says
 * "prefer capturing rather than skipping", and a per-entry `.catch` would keep
 * that bias, but it would also mean a model that systematically emits one bad
 * field (say, a `type` it keeps inventing) silently produces *no* memories
 * while looking successful. A visible zero, with the offending path in the log,
 * is the failure mode worth having; entry-level recovery hides a broken
 * contract behind partial results.

 * the files it claimed to replace, losing them outright. Rejecting the response
 * keeps `deleted` from being applied on top of a `merged` that never happened.
 *
