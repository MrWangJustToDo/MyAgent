/**
 * Why a `task` subagent stopped, and what its summary says about it.
 *
 * A subagent's run can end through several different aborts and the task summary has to
 * be honest about which one it was, because the text reaches both the transcript UI and
 * the parent model's context:
 *
 * | Reason | What happened | Summary notice |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | `user` | the user cancelled (Esc) | `[Task cancelled by user.]` |
 * | `parent-run` | the parent's run was discarded (stream restart) or ended while the subagent streamed — e.g. the approval pause that also restarts the run | `[Task stopped with its parent run.]` |
 * | `parent-stop` | the parent agent was aborted or destroyed, taking its children with it | `[Task stopped with its parent agent.]` |
 * | `unknown` | aborted, but nothing recorded why | `[Task cancelled.]` |
 *
 * The reason is read from the abort signal, which is the one channel every path
 * already flows through: `AbortController.abort(reason)` reaches the subagent as
 * `signal.reason`, so the producers are wired at once —
 *
 * - the user stop path passes `"user-cancelled"` (`AgentChatController` / local session
 *   dispatch) and it lands on the parent run's controller,
 * - `abortManagedAgentRun` passes the run-lifecycle reason (the run-lifecycle reset has
 *   none, landing as `"(no reason)"` — the stream restart behind the pre-fork orphan),
 * - `ManagedAgent.cascadeAbortToChildren` → `child.abort(reason ?? "parent-aborted")`,
 *   inheriting the parent's own reason when it has one, and
 * - `AgentManager.destroyAgent` → `abort("Agent destroyed")`.
 *
 * Reading the reason requires care about WHICH signal: the child's own
 * `run.currentAbortController.signal.reason` is where the abort/cascade paths land, while
 * the caller's `abortSignal` only carries it on the pre-fork route. Both are consulted at
 * the call site.
 *
 * `unknown` is reachable in exactly one way: an abort whose string matches nothing here
 * (an unlabelled caller). It is **not** the ".aborted but no reason recorded" slot the
 * table's wording suggests — a bare abort is classified `parent-run`, because that is the
 * lifecycle reset, and claiming "we know nothing" there would lose the distinction the
 * reason exists for. `unknown` is never returned for a non-aborted run: the caller must
 * not ask for a notice in that case at all.
 *
 * **Before this, every abort was reported as `[Task cancelled by user.]`** — the
 * constant was applied unconditionally. An orphan created by a stream restart was
 * therefore recorded as a user cancellation that never happened, in the log and in the
 * parent model's context, which is the single most expensive way this can be wrong:
 * the one artefact a reader uses to tell "the model stopped this" from "the operator
 * stopped this" asserted the wrong one.
