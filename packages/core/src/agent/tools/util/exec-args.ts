 * Run an external binary with an explicit argument vector, without a shell.
 *
 * This is the replacement for building shell command strings. Strings cannot be portable:
 * syntax valid in one shell is a parse error in another (`set -o pipefail` is not a
 * PowerShell option), so any tool that concatenates a command has silently committed to a
 * single shell family. Passing argv sidesteps the question entirely — nothing is re-parsed,
 * re-quoted, or expanded.
 *
 * Returns `missing: true` rather than throwing when the binary is absent, so callers can
 * treat "not installed" as a normal branch (which is how search tools choose between
 * candidates).
 *
 * Also treats a `null` result as missing. The remote client returns null when a server does
 * not implement the exec-file route, and dereferencing that produced a TypeError — a crash
 * where callers were written to handle an absence.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: a non-zero exit is NOT a reason to discard stdout. `find` exits non-zero after
 * printing usable hits (an unreadable subdirectory is enough) and ripgrep/grep exit 1/2 to mean
 * "no matches". Only `missing` — the binary never ran — justifies falling through to another
 * candidate; anything else that produced output is a result.

 * Run a binary and return its stdout, or `undefined` when it produced no usable result.

 *   - `missing` — the binary could not be launched, so trying the next one is the point
 *   - `killed` — the process was terminated, so an empty stdout is the absence of an answer,

 *
 * A non-zero exit is deliberately NOT one of them. Returning `undefined` for a status would
 * discard whatever the process managed to print before failing, and would make a failed search
 * indistinguishable from a successful empty one.
 *
 * Also enforces the byte ceiling: a search whose output exceeds
 * {@link SEARCH_OUTPUT_BYTE_LIMIT} is cut here rather than being buffered in full and then
 * discarded by the caller's entry-count truncation. The comparison is on UTF-8 bytes, so it
 * cannot be bypassed by multi-byte content, and the cut goes through `TextEncoder`/
