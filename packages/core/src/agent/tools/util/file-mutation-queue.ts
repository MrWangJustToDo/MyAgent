/**
 * Per-file mutation queue — serializes operations on the same file.
 *
 * Inspired by pi's approach: each file has a promise chain. Operations on the
 * same file are queued (serialized); operations on different files run in
 * parallel. Uses `path.resolve` to normalize paths so that the same file
 * accessed via different relative paths shares the same queue.
 *
 * There is no external-concurrent-modification detection (no mtime, no content
 * hash). If the file is modified outside the agent session, the oldString
 * won't match, and the tool will error naturally — the LLM re-reads and retries.
