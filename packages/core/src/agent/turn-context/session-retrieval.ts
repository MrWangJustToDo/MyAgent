/**
 * Session-retrieval guidance: where past conversation lives and how to read it.
 *
 * This is the **single source of truth** for how to search conversation history. It used to be
 * spread across the compaction summary, the compact-archive file header, `AGENTS.md`, and
 * `ARCHITECTURE.md` — two of which were frozen or near-frozen, so a wording change reached only
 * some of them. The guidance therefore lives here only.
 *
 * Discovery is deliberately **static text behind a one-time existence gate**: no counts and no
 * per-turn directory walks. A count would change the section hash whenever a session was created
 * or pruned, re-injecting the whole block and invalidating the prompt-cache prefix after it — for
 * a figure that does not change what the model should do.
