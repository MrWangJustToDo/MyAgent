/**
 * Binding-name normalisation for code-mode tools.
 *
 * `@tanstack/ai-code-mode` derives every sandbox binding name as
 * `` `${prefix}${tool.name}` `` with no character normalisation. The concatenation
 * appears twice in `dist/esm/bindings/tool-to-binding.js` — `toolsToBindings` (:12,
 * the map key) and `toolToBinding` (:50, the binding object's `name`) — and the
 * resulting key is what `create-code-mode-tool.js` passes to
 * `driver.createContext({ bindings })`, so the isolate driver installs it as a
 * sandbox global. An illegal identifier therefore breaks at two points: an unusable
 * type stub in the prompt, and a global a script can never reference.
 * A tool name containing a hyphen therefore produces a stub that is not a legal
 * JS/TS identifier:
 *
 * ```ts
 * declare function external_mcp__myserver_read-file(input: …): Promise<unknown>;
 * //                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ parses as subtraction
 * ```
 *
 * The same class of bug was fixed upstream in pi v0.99.2 (two tool names differing
 * only in `-`/`_` made a script call the wrong tool, silently). We normalise on our
 * side instead of waiting for the upstream fix, because the failure mode is invisible
 * until a user writes a script against an MCP tool.
 *
 * Two properties matter:
 *
 * - **Idempotent** — re-running over an already-normalised name returns it unchanged,
 *   so this step degrades to a no-op if upstream ever normalises too, rather than
 *   becoming a second source of renames.
 * - **Collision-safe** — normalisation maps distinct names onto one identifier
 *   (`read-file` and `read_file` both become `read_file`), so a deterministic suffix
 *   keeps both callable. Upstream's `DuplicateToolNameError` cannot catch this: it
 *   compares exact strings before any normalisation, so both names look distinct.

/**
 * Normalise every tool's name to a legal binding identifier, keeping colliding
 * tools individually callable.
 *
 * - A name that is already legal is returned as the same object (no copy), so the
 *   current curated list produces a byte-identical prompt.
 * - Distinct tools that normalise to the same identifier each get a deterministic
 *   `_<hash-of-own-name>` suffix, so the assignment depends only on the *set* of
 *   tools, never on the order they were handed in. MCP tools are collected as
 *   servers connect, so input order is not stable across runs — an order-dependent
 *   suffix would make a script that worked in one session fail in the next.
 * - The same name offered twice cannot be separated from itself and is dropped with
 *   a warning, rather than emitting a duplicate declaration.
 * - Output preserves the input order, so eager/lazy ordering is unchanged.
