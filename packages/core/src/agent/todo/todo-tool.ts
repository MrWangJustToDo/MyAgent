/**
 * The `todo` tool manages ONE list, whose plan ownership is not its business.
 *
 * There is deliberately no title argument anywhere in this file: the title is text the model
 * writes, so it cannot be an input to plan ownership. The binding is minted by the plan seed
 * path (`PlanModeController.seedTodosFromSteps` → `TodoManager.setPlanBound`) and released by
 * `PlanModeController.clearPlanTodos`; `TodoManager.update` only replaces items + title. A
 * tool that re-asserted the binding from its own title would be a second, weaker authority for
 * a decision that already has one — and the weaker one is what made an agent list named "Plan"
 * render as plan steps for the rest of the session.

 - Plan complex tasks by breaking them into steps
 - Track what you're currently working on (mark as in_progress)
 - Mark tasks as completed when done
 - Keep the user informed of your progress

IMPORTANT RULES:
 - Always include a short title for the current todo set: it labels the list for the user
 - Only ONE task can be in_progress at a time
 - Update todos frequently - mark tasks complete immediately when done
 - Each call REPLACES all todos, so include the full updated list
 - Maximum 20 todos allowed`,
