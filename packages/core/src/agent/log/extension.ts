/**
 * Built-in log extension — owns log **policy**.
 *
 * The emission seam (`AgentLog`) does level filtering, run stamping, envelope construction and
 * hands the assembled entry to a sink. Everything about *what a log looks like* and *where it
 * goes* is assembled here:
 *
 * - **Sink** — the JSONL file with size rotation (`jsonl-file-sink.ts`).
 * - **Policy** — the event→entry rule table, formatting and payload summarizing, and the
 *   subscription that applies them (`event-log-bridge.ts`).
 *
 * So this module is mostly composition: it is the one place that says "these two halves are one
 * feature", which is what makes logging removable/observable as a unit rather than a behaviour
 * spread across the seam's call sites.
 *
 * Two entry paths, and they are deliberately different mechanisms:
 *
 * 1. **The seam** — `AgentLog.debug/info/warn/error/eventEntry` (the ~76 call sites plus the
 *    `ctx.logger` facade). These pass assembled entries straight through; their routing is decided
 *    at the call site, not by a rule.
 * 2. **The bus** — every observable event, turned into entries by the rule table. This is the
 *    subscription that centralizes lifecycle logging.
 *
 * The seam is a **privileged dependency injection**, not a bus event: a log-entry event would have
 * to be deliverable to this extension, but internal events are withheld from both wildcard delivery
 * and the observation surface, and an event this extension emits to feed itself is exactly the
 * recursion the internal classification exists to prevent. Injection has that property by
 * construction — the sink never emits.
 *
 * Subagents matter for the shape of this module: they have no extension runner (only roots get one,
 * `agent-factory.ts`), yet they write logs to their own file. So the extension exposes a **sink
 * factory** that core binds per `AgentLog` — root and subagent alike — rather than a per-agent
 * extension instance.
