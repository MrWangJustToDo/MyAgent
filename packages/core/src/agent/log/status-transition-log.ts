/**
 * Status-transition log policy — which transitions are worth an `info` line.
 *
 * A run's status flips many times per turn, and most of those flips are mechanical:
 * the stream pump's `waiting ⇄ running` bracket around a tool approval, and `reconcile`
 * re-deriving a state that is already held. Logging every transition at `info` made
 * status the single largest block in a session log — 29.6k of 92.6k lines (31.9%)
 * across the recorded sessions, dominated by 6,262 `approvals-pending` ↔ 6,266
 * `reconcile` pairs that only ever restated each other.
 *
 * The level therefore follows what the transition *means*, not that it happened:
 *
 * | Transition | Level | Why |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | into `error` / `aborted` | `info` | terminal, and the outcome a reader looks for |
 * | a user-driven change (cancel, manual compact) | `info` | an actor did something |
 * | everything else, with a real trigger | `debug` | the pump's internal bookkeeping |
 * | no trigger (restore, direct set) | `info` | uncommon; likely a state nothing else explains |
 *
 * "User-driven" is judged by whether another event already records it. The abort has
 * `agent:abort`; a **manual** compact has nothing —
 * `compaction:auto-*` is off in the log rules and the only compaction event that fires is
 * the reactive one, which is internal. So `manual-compact` stays `info`: it is the single
 * trace a reader has that an operator compacted, and demoting it would delete the fact
 * rather than denoise it.
 *
 * The trigger is the discriminator because it is already the vocabulary the status
 * controller uses for *why* it is setting a status (`chunk:tool`, `reconcile`, …), so
 * the policy reads as a list of reasons rather than a list of endpoints.
 *
 * The level reaches the log through `ManagedAgent.setStatus`, which is the single
 * funnel every transition goes through — the UI state, the emitted event and the log
 * line all stay on the same path, so nothing here can make the log disagree with the
 * status the host sees.

/**
 * Triggers that fire as part of the run pump's normal bookkeeping.
 *
 * `reconcile` is listed because it *derives* a status from pending approvals and is

 * before invoking it, so what it logs is the guard having let it through, not a change
 * the user would notice.
