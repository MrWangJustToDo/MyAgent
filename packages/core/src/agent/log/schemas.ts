/**
 * Log **entry schemas** — the validation boundary of the log extension, not of the seam.
 *
 * These live in `agent/log/` (not `agent/agent-log/`, where they were written) because the only
 * runtime consumer is `jsonl-file-sink.ts`, which validates every entry before writing it — an
 * artefact of log *policy*, which the extension owns. Placing them here is what keeps the two log
 * domains one-directional at the value level:
 *
 * - `agent/log/` → `agent-log/`: **types only** (`LogEntry` et al.), so the edge is erased.
 * - `agent/agent-log/` → `agent/log/`: the sink and this schema, which is the direction the policy
 *   dependency already runs.
 *
 * While the schemas sat under `agent-log/`, `agent/log/` held two value edges into that domain
 * (`jsonl-file-sink → schemas`, `extension → lifecycle-guards`) against one value edge back
 * (`agent-log → jsonl-file-sink`) — a directory-level cycle, even though no module-level path ever
 * closed (the schema and type modules are leaves). The `agent-log/` barrel re-exports these so
 * existing consumers keep resolving; new code SHOULD import them from here.
