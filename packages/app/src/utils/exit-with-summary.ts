/**
 * The one place a host leaves: capture the exit summary, tear the session down, then exit.
 *
 * All three exit entry points (`/quit`, Ctrl+C, the command context's `exit()`) used to call
 * `host.destroy(session.id)` and `adapter.exit()` themselves, which meant the summary would have
 * needed the same three-line dance in each — and a fourth entry point added later would silently
 * miss it. They now share this.
 *
 * Order matters: the lines are built **before** `destroy`. The exit summary is a reading of the
 * live session (`snap.usage`, `snap.sessionId`), and the destroy is what removes it; building it
 * afterwards would capture a torn-down agent. The lines are then handed to the store, where the
 * already-mounted `ExitSummary` picks them up while the host's deferred `process.exit` gives Ink
 * a frame to paint.
