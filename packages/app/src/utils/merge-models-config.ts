/**
 * Merge a `ConfigEditor` draft into an existing `models.json` **document**.
 *
 * The editor writes a whole file: a single `direct` entry built from its steps.
 * That is correct on first run (there is nothing to lose) and wrong on a re-edit,
 * which is what this module exists for.
 *
 * It operates on the *raw* document (`RawModelsConfig`), not the validated one,
 * and that is the whole point. `parseModelsConfig` strips every key the schema
 * does not declare — `$schema`, a hand-written `headers` on an entry, a `global`
 * setting a newer build knows — so merging a validated document would silently
 * delete the user's own fields while reporting success. Here only the entry being
 * edited is rebuilt; every other object is carried across **by reference** and
 * re-serialized unchanged.
 *
 * Rules:
 * - the entry at `entryIndex` keeps its unknown keys: only the fields the wizard
 *   owns are replaced (see {@link WIZARD_ENTRY_KEYS}), so a hand-written `headers`
 *   on the edited entry survives a change to its `baseURL` — the user edited the
 *   connection, not the whole object;
 * - every other entry, the whole `global` block, top-level unknown keys
 *   (`$schema`) and `global`'s own unknown keys are preserved verbatim;
 * - `active.entryIndex` follows the merged entry, so saving re-opens the same
 *   connection rather than jumping to entry 0, and the previous model is kept
 *   when the new entry still offers it.
 *
 * Pure: no fs, no env, no validation. `parseModelsConfig` has already validated
 * the draft, so `draft.models` holds exactly one well-formed entry.
