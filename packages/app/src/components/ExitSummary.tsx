/**
 * The session's outcome, appended below the footer for the moment between `/quit` (or Ctrl+C)
 * and the process actually going away.
 *
 * Renders lines captured at exit time rather than reading the session here: the exit path
 * destroys the session before `process.exit` lands, so by the time this paints there may be no
 * snapshot left to read. `ctx.exit()` builds the lines while the session is still live and
 * stashes them (`beginExit(lines)`).
 *
 * The top border is what separates it from the footer above — the footer ends with its own
 * `borderTop` rule, so a second one reads as "a new region of the same screen" rather than as
 * more footer. Full width via {@link FullBox}, matching that rule.
 *
 * Ink owns this frame like any other — the exit path must not write to stdout directly, because
 * Ink tracks the terminal row by row and an external write makes it skip every row whose content
 * did not change (see `PanelOverlay`). The host's `exit()` defers `process.exit` by ~200ms, which
 * is what gives this a frame to paint in, the same arrangement `Help` uses.
