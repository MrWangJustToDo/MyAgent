 * created by `StreamMarkdown` is reused across re-renders, and `streamParse: "auto"`
 * (plus stable top-level node reuse) makes the underlying parser cache safe-markdown
 * transforms, line offsets and previously parsed stable nodes while only re-parsing
 * the appended tail. Static views (plan preview, compaction summary) intentionally
 * keep the one-shot parse.

/**
 * `streaming` is REQUIRED here, not decorative.
 *
 * 0.0.11 resolves the parse mode as `parseOptions?.final ?? !streaming`, and its default is
 * `streaming = false`. Before then the resolver was "use `parseOptions` verbatim once it
 * mentions `final` OR `streamParse`" — which `STREAMING_PARSE_OPTIONS` satisfies via
 * `streamParse`, keeping the incremental path. Under the new resolver that same object
 * reports no `final`, so the default flips to `final: true` and every live text part is
 * re-parsed whole on every chunk: the streaming cache never engages.
 *
 * Passing `streaming` restores the previous semantics exactly (`final` resolves to `false`).
 * No `height` is set, so the tail-anchored window that `streaming` also drives is inert.
 *
 * It is passed conditionally, not as a constant: a row already promoted into
 * `MessageList`'s static region is finished content, and re-parsing it incrementally there
 * would only pay the streaming bookkeeping for text that can no longer change. Those rows
 * render above the boundary, and `StaticContext` is what tells them apart — see
 * `MessageList`'s `staticMessage` wrappers.
