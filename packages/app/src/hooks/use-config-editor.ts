// Config editor overlay
//
// The model-config wizard (`ConfigEditor`) was first-run only: it rendered
// instead of `<App />` in the host bootstrap, so the connection fields could
// never be touched again without editing `.agents/config/models.json` by hand.
// This store is the mid-session entry point — `/settings config` opens it over
// the running app, and saving re-reads the file through the same unified
// pipeline so the new provider goes live without a restart.
//
// It is a full-screen swap (like the workspace / task / extension panels), not
// a stacked overlay, so the panel must be part of `isAnyPanelOpen()` — the
// editor owns the keyboard while it is up.
// ============================================================================
