/**
 * Inputs shared by the two `@codent/app` build configurations.
 *
 * There are two builds, and the difference between them is *only* dependency handling:
 *
 *   `tsdown.config.ts`         — default (`pnpm build`). Dependencies stay external.
 *   `tsdown.config.release.ts` — release (`pnpm build:release`). Dependencies are inlined.
 *
 * The default build is the one every host in this repo consumes (playground, extension,
 * cli, codent), so it is deliberately the cheap one: a dependency is built once, by whoever
 * owns it, instead of being inlined here and then bundled *again* by each host that inlines
 * `@codent/app`. Two consequences that are easy to lose sight of:
 *
 *   - **Correctness, not just size.** A host bundler resolving `reactivity-store` picks its
 *     ESM entry (`module` field) and applies its own browser aliases. A copy that was
 *     pre-inlined here is already frozen in whatever form this build chose — on a Node
 *     platform target that is the CJS entry, whose `require("react")` cannot exist in a
 *     browser. That is the shape of the regression this split fixes.
 *   - **One renderer instance.** React must resolve to a single `@my-react/react`. The
 *     rewrite below makes that true under its *real* package name, which is what a host then
 *     externalises; see the npm-vs-pnpm alias post-mortem in `tsdown.config.ts`.
 *
 * Only `tsdown.config` + a known extension is auto-discovered, so this file is never
 * mistaken for a config entry point.
 *
 * The importers deliberately spell this import with a `.ts` extension. tsdown loads its own
 * config through Node's native TypeScript support, which does **not** apply the repo's
 * `.js`-for-`.ts` ESM convention — `"./tsdown.shared.js"` fails to resolve at load time.

/**
 * The published graph must not contain the bare names `react` / `ink`.
 *
 * Our package.json points those names at @my-react/react / @my-react/react-terminal, but npm
 * does NOT dedupe an alias against the real name: a consumer ends up with two physical copies
 * of the renderer (`node_modules/@codent/app/node_modules/react` AND
 * `@my-react/react`), hence two hook dispatchers, and React silently renders nothing. pnpm
 * dedupes them — which is exactly why the repo always looked fine and only published installs
 * blanked.
 *
 * Rewritten at RESOLVE time instead of with `alias`, because `alias` also redirects TYPES:
 * `import { ReactNode } from "react"` must keep resolving to @types/react, while the runtime
 * must resolve to @my-react/react.
