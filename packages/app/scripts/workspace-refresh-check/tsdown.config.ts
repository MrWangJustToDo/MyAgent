/**
 * Bundles the workspace panel for `validate-workspace-refresh-check.mjs`, so the check mounts the
 * shipped component rather than a copy of it.
 *
 * Same renderer-rewrite plugin as the real builds: `src` writes the bare `react` / `ink` names, and
 * the app has no such dependencies — this is what makes them resolve to the single renderer instance
 * the check's own `import "@my-react/react"` resolves to. Without it the check dies at IMPORT time
 * with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` instead of reporting a result.
 *
 * One bundle, several entries, on purpose: the panel and the assertions must share ONE store graph.
 * Importing `src` through a second entry would resolve two copies of every store and produce false
 * results (the failure mode the render-smoke documents).
 *
 * Run through `pnpm --filter @codent/app run validate:workspace-refresh`.
