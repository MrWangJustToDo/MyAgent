/**
 * Self-containment guard for the fully bundled release build.
 *
 * The whole point of `codent` is that its tarball installs on its own: no
 * `@codent/*` sibling on the registry, and no workspace package in the
 * published dependency graph. That property is invisible at build time —
 * tsdown happily leaves a bare specifier in the output and the build still
 * succeeds — so it needs its own assertion. Three checks:
 *
 *   1. `dist/index.mjs` and every emitted chunk reference no `@codent/*`
 *      specifier (static `from` or dynamic `import()`). Comments are stripped
 *      first: core/node ship dozens of JSDoc examples that quote
 *      `from "@codent/core"` and would otherwise read as false positives.
 *   2. `dependencies` is exactly the external allowlist. Each one is an import
 *      the emitted bundle still makes, so omitting it ships a package that
 *      crashes with ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND on the user's first invocation
 *      (verified by installing the tarball into an empty project).
 *   3. `optionalDependencies` is drawn from the (separate) optional allowlist.
 *      Those are the native addons, which cannot be inlined and must not be
 *      `required` either: npm installs them where a prebuilt binding exists and
 *      skips them elsewhere, which is the degrade-not-crash behaviour the host
 *      wants. Keeping them in the allowlist (rather than allowing the field
 *      wholesale) means a new entry has to state its reason. Moving one into
 *      `dependencies` is the failure this guards: it would turn "image
 *      resizing is unavailable" into "the install fails".
 *   4. No `@codent/*` workspace package is declared as a dependency — those
 *      are build inputs, and publishing one would defeat the point.
 *   5. The tree-sitter grammars the host parses with are present in `dist`. They
 *      are neither inlined (`.wasm`, not JS) nor declared (a 50 MB aggregate of
 *      which 18 grammars / 22.8 MB are used), so they are **copied in at build
 *      time** by `scripts/copy-tree-sitter-grammars.mjs`. Nothing in the bundle
 *      would reveal their absence — every tree-sitter tool would just return
 *      null for a user — so it is asserted here.
