//
// `codent` is published as ONE self-contained tarball: `@codent/app`,
// `@codent/core`, `@codent/node` and every pure-JS third-party dependency
// are inlined into `dist`, so the published package declares no runtime
// `dependencies` at all and no `@codent/*` sibling has to be on the registry.
//
// Two groups must stay external and are the only things a consumer installs:
//
//   1. Renderer — `@my-react/react` + `@my-react/react-terminal`. The host must
//      resolve ONE copy; two physical copies means two hook dispatchers and the
//      TUI renders nothing. See `packages/app/tsdown.config.ts` for the full
//      npm-vs-pnpm alias post-mortem.
//   2. Asset-bearing packages — they read their own assets through
//      `import.meta.url` / `require.resolve`, which only works while they keep
//      their real on-disk layout:
//        - `@anthropic-ai/sandbox-runtime` → `vendor/seccomp/*/apply-seccomp`,
//          `vendor/srt-win/*`, `vendor/java-proxy-agent/*.jar`
//        - `web-tree-sitter` → `tree-sitter.wasm`
//        - `sharp` → its `@img/sharp-*` prebuilt binding, found by path
//        - `isolated-vm` → its `prebuilds/<platform>/` addon, found by path
//
//      The last two ship as `optionalDependencies` rather than `dependencies`.
//      A native addon cannot be inlined — the binary is not JS — and inlining
//      its loader is worse than leaving it out: the loader resolves relative to
//      itself, so an inlined copy looks for `prebuilds/` next to *our* `dist`
//      and dies with "No native build was found". Declaring them optional keeps
//      the install succeeding where no prebuilt binding exists (npm skips an
//      optional dependency it cannot build) and the call site degrades to
//      `null` instead. See `ALLOWED_OPTIONAL_EXTERNALS` in
//      `scripts/validate-self-contained.mjs`.
//
// `unpdf` (core's PDF text extractor) is deliberately NOT here: bundling it was
// verified to work. Its `import.meta.url` references are dead fallbacks behind
// `process.getBuiltinModule`, and its canvas proxy is lazy, so nothing reads a
// file next to the module — which also drops a 72 KB package from the install.
