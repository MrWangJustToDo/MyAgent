## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Command analysis is aware of the target shell

Command safety analysis MUST know which shell a command will run under, and MUST NOT assume bash
unconditionally. Platform detection alone is insufficient: a Windows host with Git Bash installed
genuinely runs bash, so the analysis MUST derive the shell kind from the same resolution that
selects the shell.

#### Scenario: Bash grammar is selected only for a bash shell

- **WHEN** a command will be executed by a bash-compatible shell
- **THEN** the bash grammar MUST be used to parse it
- **AND** this MUST hold on Windows hosts where a bash shell was resolved

#### Scenario: A non-bash shell does not get a bash parse

- **WHEN** a command will be executed by PowerShell or cmd.exe
- **THEN** it MUST NOT be parsed with the bash grammar as if it were bash
- **AND** the analysis MUST route it to the table-driven fallback rather than an AST parse

### Requirement: Unavailable shell grammar degrades loudly and safely

When no grammar is available for the target shell, the analysis MUST NOT silently behave as if the
command were unparseable-and-therefore-suspicious. It MUST apply a documented fallback, and the
report MUST carry a machine-readable flag for the degradation so hosts can surface it through
their own observability (session channels, the agent log) rather than the analysis layer writing
to a global console.

#### Scenario: Known commands stay classifiable without a grammar

- **WHEN** the target shell has no grammar and the command names a binary present in the built-in command tables
- **THEN** the analysis MUST still classify it from the tables
- **AND** a known read-only command MUST remain eligible for the read-only path

#### Scenario: The limitation is reported, not hidden

- **WHEN** the target shell has no available grammar
- **THEN** the analysis result MUST indicate that parsing was unavailable for that shell
- **AND** the report MUST be consumable by host-side reporting (a flag on the report), not only reflected in the approval outcome

#### Scenario: Unknown commands stay conservative

- **WHEN** the target shell has no grammar and the command is not present in the built-in tables
- **THEN** the analysis MUST NOT grant read-only status
- **AND** the default outcome MUST be the conservative one

### Requirement: An unavailable grammar must not disable tool execution

A shell-parsing gap MUST NOT make `run_command` unavailable to subagents. Today a parse failure
falls into the approval default, which subagents downgrade to a denial, so a missing grammar
becomes a silent loss of capability with no actionable message.

#### Scenario: Subagent can still run a known read-only command

- **WHEN** a subagent issues a read-only command on a host whose shell has no grammar
- **THEN** the command MUST be permitted
- **AND** it MUST NOT be denied with a message telling the model to ask the main agent for approval

#### Scenario: Genuinely risky commands are still denied

- **WHEN** a subagent issues a command that is not classified as read-only
- **THEN** it MUST still be denied
- **AND** the relaxation MUST NOT apply to unrecognised or write-capable commands

### Requirement: Command tables cover Windows-native commands

The arity table and the file-command classification sets MUST cover Windows-native commands so that
approval normalization is not Unix-only. Table entries MUST be additive: existing POSIX behaviour
MUST NOT change.

#### Scenario: Windows file commands are classified

- **WHEN** a command such as `dir`, `type`, `copy`, `del`, `move`, `findstr`, or `where` is analysed
- **THEN** it MUST be recognized by the command tables
- **AND** its read-only or write classification MUST be correct

#### Scenario: Windows command lookup has an arity entry

- **WHEN** the Windows command-lookup command is normalized
- **THEN** it MUST be treated as the platform counterpart of the POSIX lookup command
- **AND** its normalized prefix MUST NOT retain arguments that should have been dropped

#### Scenario: POSIX classification is unchanged

- **WHEN** a POSIX command is analysed after Windows entries are added
- **THEN** its normalization and classification MUST be identical to the behaviour before this change
